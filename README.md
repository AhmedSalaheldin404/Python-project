🇬🇧 Mini Python Project with React – Interactive Data Visualization
📊 Overview

Mini Python + React Project is a simple yet powerful web application that allows users to input data dynamically and visualize it instantly using interactive charts.
It demonstrates smooth communication between a Python backend (Flask/Django/FastAPI) and a React frontend, focusing on data handling and real-time visualization.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Recharts / Chart.js

Backend: Python (Flask / FastAPI / Django)

Communication: RESTful API (JSON)

Styling: Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap

💡 Core Features

🧍‍♂️ User Input Form: Collect data dynamically from users.

🔄 API Integration: Data is sent to the Python backend through REST APIs.

📈 Charts Visualization: Render dynamic charts (bar, line, or pie) in real-time using React.

💾 Optional Data Storage: Store submitted data in memory or a small database (like SQLite).

⚡ Responsive Design: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices.

🧠 Concept

The project demonstrates how a React frontend can interact with a Python backend to build data-driven dashboards.
It’s great for learning full-stack integration, API communication, and data visualization.

🎯 Goal

To create a mini full-stack project that helps visualize data entered by users in an intuitive and interactive way — ideal for learning or portfolio demonstration.
